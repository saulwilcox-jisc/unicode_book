.. _character:

Character
---------

Generic term for a semantic symbol. Many possible interpretations exist in the context of encoding.

In computing, the most important aspect is that characters can be letters, spaces or control characters which represent the end of a file or can be used to trigger a sound.

.. _glyph:

Glyph
-----

One or more shapes that may be combined into a grapheme.

In Latin, a glyph often has 2 variants like "A" and "a" and Arabic often has four. This term is context dependent and different styles or formats can be considered different glyphs.

Most relevant in programming is that diacritic marks (e.g. accents like ` and ^) are also glyphs, which are sometimes represented with another at one point, like "à" in ISO 8859-1 or as two separate glyphs "a" and the combining "`" (U+0300 and U+0061, combined as U+00E0).

.. _code point:

Code point
----------

A **code point** is an unsigned integer. The smallest code point is zero. Code
points are usually written as hexadecimal, e.g. "0x20AC" (8,364 in decimal).


.. _charset:

Character set (charset)
-----------------------

A **character set**, abbreviated **charset**, is a mapping between :ref:`code
points <code point>` and :ref:`characters <character>`. The mapping has a fixed
size.  For example, most 7 bits encodings have 128 entries, and most 8 bits
encodings have 256 entries. The biggest charset is the :ref:`Unicode Character
Set <ucs>` 6.0 with 1,114,112 entries.

In some charsets, code points are not all contiguous. For example, the
:ref:`cp1252 <cp1252>` charset maps code points from 0 though 255, but it has
only 251 entries: 0x81, 0x8D, 0x8F, 0x90 and 0x9D code points are not assigned.

Examples of the :ref:`ASCII <ascii>` charset: the digit five ("5", U+0035) is
assigned to the code point 0x35 (53 in decimal), and the uppercase letter "A"
(U+0041) to the code point 0x41 (65).

The biggest code point depends on the size of the charset. For example, the
biggest code point of the ASCII charset is 127 (:math:`2^7-1`)

Charset examples:

+-----------------------+------------+-------------+
|          Charset      | Code point | Character   |
+=======================+============+=============+
|        ASCII          |   0x35     | 5 (U+0035)  |
+-----------------------+------------+-------------+
|        ASCII          |   0x41     | A (U+0041)  |
+-----------------------+------------+-------------+
|      ISO-8859-15      |   0xA4     | € (U+20AC)  |
+-----------------------+------------+-------------+
| Unicode Character Set |  0x20AC    | € (U+20AC)  |
+-----------------------+------------+-------------+


.. _str:

Character string
----------------

A **character string**, or "Unicode string", is a string where each unit is a
:ref:`character <character>`. Depending on the implementation, each character
can be any Unicode character, or only characters in the range U+0000—U+FFFF,
range called the :ref:`Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) <bmp>`. There are 3
different implementations of character strings:

 * array of 32 bits unsigned integers (the :ref:`UCS-4 <ucs4>` encoding): full
   Unicode range
 * array of 16 bits unsigned integers (:ref:`UCS-2 <ucs2>`): BMP only
 * array of 16 bits unsigned integers with :ref:`surrogate pairs
   <surrogates>` (:ref:`UTF-16 <utf16>`): full Unicode range

UCS-4 uses twice as much memory than UCS-2, but it supports all Unicode
characters. UTF-16 is a compromise between UCS-2 and UCS-4: characters in the
BMP range use one UTF-16 unit (16 bits), characters outside this range use two
UTF-16 units (a :ref:`surrogate pair <surrogates>`, 32 bits). This advantage is
also the main disadvantage of this kind of character string.

The length of a character string implemented using UTF-16 is the number of
UTF-16 units, and not the number of characters, which is confusing. For
example, the U+10FFFF character is :ref:`encoded <encode>` as two UTF-16 units: {U+DBFF,
U+DFFF}. If the character string only contains characters of the BMP range, the
length is the number of characters. Getting the n\ :sup:`th` character or the
length in characters using UTF-16 has a complexity of :math:`O(n)`, whereas
it has a complexity of :math:`O(1)` for UCS-2 and UCS-4 strings.

The :ref:`Java` language, the :ref:`Qt <qt>` library and :ref:`Windows 2000
<win>` implement character strings with UTF-16. The :ref:`C <c>` and :ref:`Python
<python>` languages use UTF-16 or UCS-4 depending on: the size of the
:c:type:`wchar_t` type (16 or 32 bits) for C, and the compilation mode (narrow
or wide) for Python. Windows 95 uses UCS-2 strings.

   :ref:`UCS-2 <ucs2>`, :ref:`UCS-4 <ucs4>` and :ref:`UTF-16 <utf16>` encodings,
   and :ref:`surrogate pairs <surrogates>`.


.. _bytes:

Byte string
-----------

A **byte string** is a :ref:`character string <str>` :ref:`encoded <encode>` to an
:ref:`encoding <encoding>`. It is implemented as an array of 8 bits unsigned
integers. It can be called by its encoding. For example, a byte string encoded
to :ref:`ASCII <ascii>` is called an "ASCII encoded string", or simply an
"ASCII string".

The :ref:`character range <charset>` supported by a byte string depends on its
encoding, because an encoding is associated with a :ref:`charset <charset>`. For
example, an ASCII string can only store characters in the range U+0000—U+007F.

The encoding is not stored explicitly in a byte string. If the encoding is not
documented or attached to the byte string, :ref:`the encoding has to be
guessed <guess>`, which is a difficult task. If a byte string is :ref:`decoded <decode>` from
the wrong encoding, it will not be displayed correctly, leading to a well known
issue: :ref:`mojibake <mojibake>`.

The same problem occurs if two byte strings encoded to different encodings are
concatenated. **Never concatenate byte strings encoded to different
encodings!** Use character strings, instead of byte strings, to avoid mojibake
issues.

:ref:`PHP5 <php>` only supports byte strings. In the :ref:`C language <c>`,
"strings" are usually byte strings which are implemented as the :c:type:`char*`
type (or :c:type:`const char*`).

.. seealso::

   The :c:type:`char*` type of the C language and the :ref:`mojibake
   <mojibake>` issue.


UTF-8 encoded strings and UTF-16 character strings
--------------------------------------------------

A :ref:`UTF-8 <utf8>` string is a particular case, because UTF-8 is able to
encode all Unicode characters [1]_ . But a UTF-8 string is not a Unicode string
because the string unit is byte and not character: you can get an individual
byte of a multibyte character.

.. TODO:: Nelle : un exemple de ce dernier cas serais, je pense, le bienvenue
  ici

Another difference between UTF-8 strings and Unicode strings is the complexity
of getting the nth character: :math:`O(n)` for the byte string and :math:`O(1)`
for the Unicode string. There is one exception: if the Unicode string is
implemented using UTF-16: it has also a complexity of :math:`O(n)`.

.. [1] A UTF-8 encoder :ref:`should not encode <strict utf8 decoder>` :ref:`surrogate characters <surrogates>` (U+D800—U+DFFF).


.. _encoding:

Encoding
--------

An **encoding** describes how to :ref:`encode <encode>` :ref:`code points <code
point>` to bytes and how to :ref:`decode <decode>` :ref:`bytes <bytes>` to code
points.

An encoding is always associated with a :ref:`charset <charset>`. For example,
the UTF-8 encoding is associated with the Unicode charset. So we can say that an
encoding :ref:`encodes <encode>` characters to bytes and decode bytes to characters, or more
generally, it encodes a :ref:`character string <str>` to a :ref:`byte string
<bytes>` and decodes a byte string to a character string.

The 7 and 8 bits charsets have the simplest encoding: store a code point as a
single byte. Since these charsets are also called encodings, it is easy to confuse
them. The best example is the :ref:`ISO-8859-1 encoding <ISO-8859-1>`: all of
the 256 possible bytes are considered as 8 bit code points (0 through 255) and
are mapped to characters. For example, the character A (U+0041) has the
code point 65 (0x41 in hexadecimal) and is stored as the byte ``0x41``.

Charsets with more than 256 entries cannot encode all code points into a single
byte. The encoding encodes all code points into byte sequences of the same
length or of variable length. For example, :ref:`UTF-8` is a variable length
encoding: code points lower than 128 use a single byte, whereas higher code
points take 2, 3 or 4 bytes. The :ref:`UCS-2 <ucs2>` encoding encodes all
code points into sequences of two bytes (16 bits).

.. TODO:: NELLE : je ne m'y connais pas trop en encodage, mais il me semble
  que ce que tu affirmes dans le paragraphe précédent n'est pas tout à fait
  correct: un encodage associe un character/glyphe/symbole avec quelque chose
  d'autre, comme une série d'entier, d'octet ou n'importe quoi (en fait plus
  exactement, pour moi de l'encodage, c'est une maniere d'associer X à Y, avec
  la possibilité de décoder de Y vers X). Si tu prends l'article de wikipédia
  sur le sujet (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding), il mentionne
  le code morse. Le pire dans tout ça, c'est qu'il me semble qu'il existe
  différent type de code morse pour différent language. Entre, la chine.

  Bref, tout ça pour dire que je ne suis pas d'accord sur le fait que : "7 and
  8 bits don't need any encoding". Tu associes une série de booléen à un
  caractère, donc par définition, il y a encodage. Cependant, je suppose que
  c'est un encodage "standard"


.. _encode:

Encode a character string
-------------------------

Encode a :ref:`character string <str>` to a :ref:`byte string <bytes>`, to an
encoding. For example, encode "Hé" to :ref:`UTF-8 <utf8>` gives ``0x48 0xC3
0xA9``.

By default, most libraries are :ref:`strict <strict>`: raise an error at the
first :ref:`unencodable character <unencodable>`. Some libraries allow to
choose :ref:`how to handle them <errors>`.

Most encodings are stateless, but some encoding requires a stateful encoder.
For example, the :ref:`UTF-16 <utf16>` encoding starts by generating a
:ref:`BOM <bom>`, ``0xFF 0xFE`` or ``0xFE 0xFF`` depending on the endian.


.. _decode:

Decode a byte string
--------------------

Decode a :ref:`byte string <bytes>` from an encoding to a :ref:`character
string <str>`. For example, decode ``0x48 0xC3 0xA9`` from :ref:`UTF-8 <utf8>`
gives "Hé".

By default, most libraries raise an error if :ref:`a byte sequence cannot be
decoded <undecodable>`. Some libraries allow to choose :ref:`how to handle them
<errors>`.

Most encodings are stateless, but some encoding requires a stateful decoder.
For example, the :ref:`UTF-16 <utf16>` encoding decodes the two first bytes as
a :ref:`BOM <bom>` to read the endian (use UTF-16-LE or UTF-16-BE).


.. index:: Mojibake
.. _mojibake:

Mojibake
--------

When a :ref:`byte strings <bytes>` is :ref:`decoded <decode>` from the wrong
encoding, or when two byte strings encoded to different encodings are
concatenated, a program will display **mojibake**.

The classical example is a latin string (with diacritics) encoded to UTF-8 but
decoded from ISO-8859-1. It displays Ã© {U+00C3, U+00A9} for the é (U+00E9)
letter, because é is encoded to ``0xC3 0xA9`` in UTF-8.

.. note::

   "Mojibake" is japanese word meaning literally "unintelligible sequence of
   characters". This issue is called "Кракозябры" (krakozyabry) in Russian.
